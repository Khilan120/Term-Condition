One of the most important aspects of the app's terms and conditions is the requirement that users maintain the confidentiality of their account information.

Users are responsible for all activity that occurs under their account, and must report any suspicious activity to the bakery immediately.

Users must also agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using the app. This includes not engaging in any illegal activities, such as hacking or copyright infringement. Users must respect the bakery's intellectual property, including trademarks, logos, and images, and not use any content or materials without permission.

The bakery reserves the right to terminate or suspend a user's account at any time, for any reason, including if the user violates the app's terms and conditions, engages in suspicious activity, or otherwise poses a risk to other users. Users must also agree to not create multiple accounts, impersonate another user, or engage in any behavior that could harm the bakery or its customers.

Users are responsible for any content they post or upload to the app, including reviews, comments, and other user-generated content.

The bakery reserves the right to remove any content that violates these policies, and to take any other action it deems necessary to enforce the app's terms and conditions.

While the Patel Bakery App is designed to provide a safe and convenient experience for users, the bakery is not liable for any damages or losses resulting from the use or inability to use the app, or for any content or materials on the app. Users must agree to hold the bakery harmless for any such damages or losses.

The bakery's privacy policy is an important part of the app's terms and conditions.

The terms and conditions of the Patel Bakery App are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the bakery is located.
